# ed-markdown-parser
A simple markdown parser built in zig. The implementation is divided in frontend and backend. Where the backend parses markdown and frontend renders html. Initially Claude Code is used for implementation to serve a purpose on a personal project. The overall goal is to use this project to learn zig and learn to write parsers.
